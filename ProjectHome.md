A program created for TripleA players and map-makers that simplifies the creation of TripleA maps. It allows players to create their own maps step by step, and removes the hassle of using command prompt commands or .bat files to run and use the map utilities. The map creator also assists with many other tasks such as it's ability to automatically find all the map's territory connections. It also lets you load and edit maps already made, making it simple to create new mods. The map creator is developed in Visual C# so it will only run on windows 98 and higher. If the program won't start, you may not have the .NET Framework installed. To install it, click on the '.NET Framework 2.0 SP1' link to the right and follow the instructions.

<b>Note: Version 2.0 Beta has been released! If you'd like to help with beta-testing, or if you'd just like a peek at all the new features, you can download the program here: <a href='http://code.google.com/p/tripleamapcreator/downloads/list'>http://code.google.com/p/tripleamapcreator/downloads/list</a></b>
